# Project Name

The Git Journal Hook is a simple yet powerful Git hook that enhances your commit messages by automatically organizing them into a structured journal. When a commit message contains a specified separator, the hook separates the message into distinct parts, appends the first part to the commit message file, and logs the remaining information, including branch details and timestamp, into a coding journal file.
